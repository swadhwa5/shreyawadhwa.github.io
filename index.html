				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<br>
				<p>I am a rising sophomore at Johns Hopkins University, majoring in Computer Science and Cognitive Science. I love sitting and struggling for hours while 
					writing code and I have worked with C, C++, Python, and Java, as well as SQL and R. This summer, I have been learning web development using React, and also
					working on the software development team of a Covid-19 Modelling project that aims to predict the spread of the disease in a personalized way for smaller communities. 
					<br><br>Since the spring of my freshman year, I have been involved with 
					the Bonner Lab on campus, where I work Dr. Mick Bonner and Dr. Alon Hafri to hypothesize why certain regions of the brain develop 'functional selectivity' to scenes, or to objects. I have had an amazing experience 
					working as a Research Assistant where my work ranges from generating a 3000+ image stimulus set to attending talks and reading papers written by some of the 
					most prominent cognitive scientists in the world.
